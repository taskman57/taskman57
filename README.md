## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

Since much of my work is proprietary and covered by NDA, I use this space to share:

- FPGA design examples and reusable modules  
- High-speed interface demos and test projects  
- DSP/Video processing reference implementations  
- Utilities, scripts, tools, and design workflows  
- Notes on best practices for timing closure and architecture  

I’m gradually publishing open-source friendly versions of concepts I’ve used in production systems.

## 🌱 Currently Working On

- Packaging reusable FPGA IP modules for open-source release  
- Creating example designs for common high-speed interfaces  
- Documenting techniques for building scalable DSP pipelines  
- Developing simulation and test benches for public FPGA examples
